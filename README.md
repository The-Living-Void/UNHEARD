Hello QT,

These are all the files used for the installation UNHEARD commisioned by Noorderlicht for the show Pixel Perceptions.
It has the installation running files (processing) & The Ai training files (the .py files)
ive put further descriptions in the seperate files.

Please keep in mind: This is very much v0.1 and I will update once i get things running more smoothly. This is very much a patchwork of different work-arounds and pragmatic time pressured imperfect solutions. 

Here are a few prerequisites:
An Ultraleap Leap Motion hand tracker.
You need GECO an Leap motion to midi software.
There are a bunch of libraries to install with pip i will make a file with my versions for ref. (i would recommend making a new environment)
I am using an enttec box to control the lights, and arduino for the lights in the pillar.

Feel free to use these codes in any ways you see fit. As long as you make the world a better place <3
